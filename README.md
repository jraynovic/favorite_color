Future addditions:
    -The ability to change the pool of colors.
    -Add history to show what colors have been selected recently as a favorite.
    Currently the server side is capable and planned to have these options. The client side will need further implemation to acheive these abilities

How to run: 
  1) clone repo
  2) run 'npm i' or 'yarn' to install dependencies
